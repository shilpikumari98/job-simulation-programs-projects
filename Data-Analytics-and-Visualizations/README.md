## Data Analytics & Visualization Project: Accenture NA

I'm thrilled to showcase my work on the Data Analytics & Visualization project completed through Accenture NA's job simulation program on Forage. This experience provided me with invaluable insights into various tasks pertinent to data analysis and visualization. Here's a glimpse into what I achieved:

**Tasks:**

Throughout the Program, I delved into advising social media clients, where I leveraged data analytics techniques to provide informed recommendations.

**Task 1: Requirements Gathering**
- **Objective**: Understand the client’s (Social Buzz) needs to identify key content trends.
- **Focus**: Identify main data sources, define important metrics (e.g., engagement, reaction types).
- **Outcome**: Established data collection and analysis goals focused on popular content categories and audience engagement patterns.

**Task 2: Data Cleaning**
- **Objective**: Prepare clean, reliable data for analysis.
- **Steps**:
  - Removed duplicates and irrelevant data.
  - Standardized reaction categories and content type names.
  - Handled missing values to maintain data integrity.
- **Outcome**: A clean, consistent dataset ready for effective modeling and analysis.

**Task 3: Data Modeling and Analysis**
- **Objective**: Organize and analyze data to identify trends.
- **Steps**:
  - Combined multiple datasets using SQL joins.
  - Applied aggregation techniques to calculate engagement metrics by category and month.
  - Analyzed monthly trends and overall engagement by content type.
- **Outcome**: Insightful metrics on popular categories (e.g., “Animal” and “Healthy eating”) and monthly engagement trends.

**Task 4: Visualization and Presentation**
- **Objective**: Communicate insights clearly to stakeholders.
- **Tools Used**: Excel for data manipulation; PowerPoint and visualizations for presentation.
- **Visualizations Created**:
  - Bar charts for reaction counts across categories.
  - Pie and donut charts for proportion of engagement by content type.
- **Outcome**: Provided a comprehensive report showcasing content popularity, engagement insights, and actionable recommendations for content strategy.

**Data Analysis:**

One of the highlights of this project was the analysis of seven distinct datasets aimed at uncovering content trends. Through rigorous analysis, I was able to extract valuable insights that informed strategic decisions.

**Stakeholder Presentations:**

An integral aspect of the Program involved preparing presentations tailored for stakeholders. These presentations encapsulated key findings and recommendations derived from data analysis, effectively communicating insights to stakeholders.

**Sharing Work on GitHub:**

I'm excited to share my project work on GitHub, where you can explore the methodologies, analyses, and insights generated throughout the Program. Your feedback and insights are highly appreciated as I continue to refine my skills in data analytics and visualization.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project. I'm eager to continue my journey in the realm of data analytics and visualization, and I look forward to your valuable input.
